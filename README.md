# CryptoClustering

The UNC Chapel Hill AI Boot Camp Module 11 Challenge examines price changes over intervals of 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year. It uses the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies based on their price fluctuations across these time frames.
